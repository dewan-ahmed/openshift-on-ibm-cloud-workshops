# Kubernetes Basics

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node. The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability. The kube-api-server, or API Server in short, is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster that handles scheduling, HA etc. In this lab, we'll be executing various Kubernetes commands/operations by using the powerful **kubectl** CLI which will talk to the API Server. It is possible to access the API Server via REST calls or officially supported client libraries but **kubectl** CLI is the most common and preferred way.
